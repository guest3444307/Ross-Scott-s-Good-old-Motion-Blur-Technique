# Ross-Scott-s-Good-old-Motion-Blur-Technique
This right here is (roughly) what Ross Scott uses, remember to read the tutorial for installation

Tutorial:

1. Download The files from here (of course)
2. Download AVISynth (2.8 is what i used, im not sure if AVISynth+ works or not
3. Get VirtualDub (most up to date will probably work
4. Follow this tutorial instead! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPkJfiY8Fm7D56rDZKSuC1HfFohTYVfxr Its out of date but it will get you most of the way here (because i haven't done this in months! You can skip most of the videos, just look for the motion blur related ones! Hopefully they dont get taken down as i still question whether this is Ross Scott Approved(TM)
Hopefully im not missing anything!
